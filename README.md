## Analyzing Baseball League Data From The Lahmann2013.sqlite Database Using R And SQLite

This is an assignment for my STA141B (Data and Web Technologies for Data Analysis) class in UC Davis taught by Prof. Duncan Temple Lang. The goal of the assignment is to obtain useful information from the Lahmann database by writing SQLite queries and producing plots using R.

The codes used in this analysis are all contained in the `baseballCodes.R` file. A total of 23 questions were answered in `report.pdf` in this analysis.
